# password-generator

Description:
This was a random password generator that I created using a combination of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters chosen by the user. The minimum number of characters was 8 and the maximum number of characters is 128. After the user enters their choices, the computer automatically generates a random password of the specified number of characters of the user's choosing, and displays it in the box. The entire javascript was built by me, while the html and CSS were already created.
